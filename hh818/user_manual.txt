Project Proposal

The 311 services of NYC provide access to non-emergency municipal services handling complaints about building conditions, noise, street condition, and sanitation. This project intends to use the dataset recording all NYC 311 service requests from 2010 to present, to allow users to compare the conditions of neighborhoods.

Building conditions: complaints about heat, water system, plumbing, and etc.
Noise: party noises, noises from commercial areas, from construction, and etc.
Street conditions: broken road, sidewalk, street sign, or signal, illegal parking, and etc.
Sanitation: complaints about unsanitary conditions in retaurants, rodent, bedbugs, public urination and such.

To start the program, the user will first have to download the zip file '9jXgd32QPSBb52EJ.311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present.csv.tar.gz' to the 'hh818' directory from the link:

https://drive.google.com/a/nyu.edu/folderview?id=0B5zgnbZs59JmfmpLUUJyN3I3ckI4NUtGb3NOTDJSRTExOXRzZlFHNExRZkpmRGNIeVJJMWM&usp=sharing#

Go to the directory 'hh818', un-zip the file that was just downloaded and then run the python program 'final_project.py'. As for now, the dataset consists of data from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 due to constraint on file size and the time it takes to load. If the user shall want to analyze data from a longer period of time, data set can be downloaded on the NYC Open Data site (https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9). Just be sure to download the csv version, save as its default name in the hh818 directory.
Once the csv file is successfully read by the program, the program will then prompt the user to enter a location in New York City (either a zip code or a borough) in addition to choosing which type of complaint to focus on (choose one from building conditions, noise, street condition, and sanitation). The program will then save the graphs in pdf presenting the frequency of complaints by month throughout the year of 2014 in the working directory by the name (complaint type)_complaints_(location).pdf. The program will keep on repromting until the user wishes to quit.
To quit, simply enter 'quit' when promt to give input.

Thank you for using the program!
